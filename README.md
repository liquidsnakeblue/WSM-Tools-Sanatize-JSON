# JSON Sanitization Invocable Action

An Apex Invocable Action that sanitizes JSON strings by removing control characters (newlines, carriage returns, tabs) that can cause "Invalid JSON payload" errors when calling external APIs from Salesforce Flows.

## Problem

Flow text templates inject field values directly into JSON. If a field like `MailingStreet` contains a newline character, the resulting JSON becomes malformed and API calls fail.

## Solution

A reusable Apex action that sanitizes the entire JSON payload before sending it to an external API.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SanitizeJSON.cls` | Invocable action that removes control characters |
| `SanitizeJSONTest.cls` | Test class with 100% coverage |

## Deployment

### Option A: Salesforce Setup UI

1. Navigate to **Setup** → **Apex Classes** → **New**
2. Paste the contents of `SanitizeJSON.cls` and save
3. Repeat for `SanitizeJSONTest.cls`
4. Run tests: **Setup** → **Apex Test Execution** → **SanitizeJSONTest**

### Option B: SFDX CLI

```bash
# Sandbox or scratch org
sfdx force:source:push

# Production
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/classes -l RunSpecifiedTests -r SanitizeJSONTest
```

## Usage in Flow

### 1. Create Flow Variables

Create text variables to store the sanitized output:
- `SanitizedWithoutCoAppBody`
- `SanitizedWithCoAppBody`

### 2. Add Sanitize Action Before HTTP Calls

1. Add an **Action** element before each HTTP callout
2. Search for **"Sanitize JSON String"**
3. Set the input to your JSON body variable (e.g., `{!WithoutCoAppBodyCalc}`)
4. Store the output in your sanitized variable (e.g., `{!SanitizedWithoutCoAppBody}`)

### 3. Update HTTP Call

Change the HTTP call **Body** to use the sanitized variable instead of the original.

### Flow Structure

```
[Auth Call]
    → [Decision: Co-Applicant?]
        → Yes: [Sanitize Body With CoApp] → [HTTP Call CoApp]
        → No:  [Sanitize Body Without CoApp] → [HTTP Call]
```

## Troubleshooting

**Action not appearing in Flow?**
- Verify the Apex class compiled without errors
- Refresh Flow Builder or clear browser cache

**HTTP calls still failing?**
- Add a debug element to verify the sanitized variable is being used
- Check for other issues (invalid field lengths, missing required fields, etc.)
